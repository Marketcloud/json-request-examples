Naturally cloudy and shining silky gold in the glass under a really strong head of foam. At the first mouthful this Weißbier classic has a mild aroma of banana. Finer palates detect a trace of mango and pineapple and the balance between sweet and bitter. Beer connoisseurs appreciate the fine note of yeast and the mild but sparkling mix of aromas. It is a typical beergarden beer, which brings people together all over the world.\",\"price\" : \"1.50\",\"stock_level\" : \"1256\",\"published\":\"true\"}"
